You'll have to replace the default icons and favicon with your own to make your blog unique.

Replace these files with your own:

- `app/favicon.ico`
- `app/apple-icon.png`
- `app/icon.png`

Commit the changes and push them to your repository.

```bash
git add app/favicon.ico app/apple-icon.png app/icon.png
git commit -m "Change icons and favicon"
git push
```
